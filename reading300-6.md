Although some skeptics points to Arctic places such as the high latitudes of Greenland, where temperatures seem to have fallen, a recent scientific report concludes that in recent decades average temperatures have increased faster in the Arctic than elsewhere. Scientists have long suspected that several factors lead to greater temperature swings at Earths polar regions than elsewhere. First, most of the Arctic is covered in snow and ice, which are highly reflective; if snow and ice melt, the exposed soil, which absorbs heat, serves to accelerate warming. Second, the polar atmosphere is thin, so little energy is required to warm it. Third, less solar energy is lost in evaporation at the frigid poles than in the tropics.

In pointing to the apparent temperature change in the high latitudes of Greenland, the skeptics mentioned in the passage intend to raise as a question whether

A Greenland is less likely to experience extreme temperature changes than are other areas of the Arctic.

B Those more localized temperature drops might indicate an important trend not captured by the upward trend of average Arctic temperatures.

C There might be a reversal of the temperature trend in the high latitudes of Greenland.

D The factors that cause temperature change in the high latitudes of Greenland are different from those that affect the rest of the Arctic.

E Greenland has more ice and snow on the ground than do other areas of the Arctic.

本题的难点在于B和C。网上讨论也是莫衷一是，我支持B因为B说的更general，Greenland->localized这个范围更广，而且也谈不上过度推理。C稍微差一点，尤其是a reversal of the temperature trend，暗示Greenland高纬度地区之前有过一个上升的trend，现在开始下降了。有无中生有的嫌疑。


The passage mentions which of the following as factors that might lead to large temperature swings in Earths polar regions?

A the amount of energy lost due to evaporation at the poles

B soil exposure due to melting snow

C the relatively thin atmosphere at the poles

这是对文章123的直接重复。
