African American drama has, until recently, been rooted in the mimetic tradition of modern American naturalism. The most distinctive attribute of this tradition is the mechanistic, materialistic conception of humanity. Naturalism sees each individual as inextricably bound to the environment and depicts each person as someone controlled by, instead of controlling, concrete reality. As long as African American drama maintained naturalism as its dominant mode, it could only express the "plight of African American people". Its heroes might declare the madness of reality, but reality inevitably triumphed over them.

The surrealistic plays of Adrienne Kennedy mark one of the first departures from naturalism by an African American dramatist. The overall goal of her work has been to depict the world of the soul and the spirit, not to mirror concrete reality. Within this framework, Kennedy has been able to portray African American minds and souls liberated from their connections to the external environment.

Which of the following statements, if true, would most strengthen the authors assertion that Kennedy's work marks a serious departure from the tradition described in the first paragraph?

A Kennedy places the action in a real-life setting that is nevertheless unfamiliar to the average viewer or reader.

B Kennedy movingly portrays the lives and struggles of prominent African Americans in the United States.

C Kennedy uses characters found only in ancient African legends and mythology.

D Kennedy provides insights into American mimetic tradition and dramatic convention.

E Kennedy depicts the events in a style reminiscent of a television documentary.

解答本题有如下线索：

1. naturalism 自然主义取反就是传说神话

2. depict the world of the soul and the spirit, not to mirror concrete reality. 神话传说不会是concrete reality

其他选项A里的places the action in a real-life setting完全不对，B里的 portrays the lives and struggles 可以是现实中的struggle，而且更像是第一段里的plight of African American people。
D选项、E选项和问题没什么关系。
