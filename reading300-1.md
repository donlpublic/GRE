Although social learning (the acquisition of specific behaviors by observing other individuals exhibiting those behaviors ) is well documented among fish, few studies have investigated social learning within a developmental context in these taxa. Rather than investigating the development of a particular skill, Chapman, Ward, and Krause investigated the role of group density during development in later foraging success in laboratory-housed guppies. When raised with a small number of conspecifics (members of the same species ), guppies were quicker to locate food by following a trained adult guppy than were guppies raised in large groups. This counterintuitive finding is explained by the fact that guppies reared in the high-density condition were less likely to shoal (swim in a group ) with others and, therefore, were less likely to learn the benefits of social learning. Instead, fish reared in high-density situations may learn that conspecifics are to be viewed as competitors, rather than as potential sources of adaptive information. This finding suggests that at least for guppies, the early social environment may have an effect on the capacity for social learning, if not on the socially learned behaviors themselves.

对于鱼类，尽管已经有大量关于其社会学习（通过观察其他个体表现出的特定行为来获得这些行为）的记录，但对于这些分类群，很少有在发展背景下对其进行的研究。查普曼、沃德和克劳斯没有调查某种特定技能的习得，而是调查了实验室饲养的石首鱼在发育过程中群体密度对后来习得觅食技能的作用。相比于在大群体中饲养的石首鱼，与少量的同胞（同一物种的成员）一起饲养的石首鱼通过跟随受过训练的成年石首鱼能更快地找到食物。这一反常的发现可以解释为，在高密度条件下饲养的石首鱼不太可能与其他人一起群聚游泳，因此，不太可能学习社会学习的好处。相反，在高密度条件下饲养的鱼可能学会了将同族人视为竞争对手，而不是适应性信息的潜在来源。这一发现表明，至少对石首鱼来说，早期的社会环境可能对社会学习的能力有影响，如果不是对社会学习行为本身有影响的话。

Regarding research on fish, it can be inferred from the passage that

 research studies of the acquisition of important skills by fish have only recently begun to document the role of conspecifics in the learning process
 这里试图将一个团队的研究偷换概念变成research studies have only recently begun

 research on social learning in guppies suggests that guppies differ in important ways from most other fish in the means by which they learn particular skills
 guppies differ in important ways from most other fish这个属于无中生有，而且与文章主旨不符合，文章更有可能是把guppies当作fish的一个代表
 
 research on social learning in fish has generally focused on the acquisition of skills other than foraging
 这个也属于无中生有，文章主要就是在讨论foraging
 
 research has established that social learning occurs in some fish species without investigating the development context in which it occurs.
直接对第一句话改写。
 
 research to investigate social learning has been done more extensively on fish than on other aquatic animals.
 全文没有谈到other aquatic animals


Which of the following can be inferred about the study by Chapman, Ward, and Krause?
A It was initially designed to investigate something other than social learning.
无中生有
B It required researchers to observe individual guppies at multiple points in their life spans.
正确。during development in later foraging success这个本身imply了一个过程
C It pointed to the possibility that population density may have little to do with guppies` social learning.
和原文完全相反
D It required the observation of guppies under conditions that closely mimicked the conditions of guppies in the wild.
D有一定的合理性，设计一个良好的实验确实需要模拟真实环境，但是原文对此只字不提，很难说我们能imply出来。
E It indicated that guppies gain adaptive information from being reared with a relatively large number of conspecifics.
跟原文相反
