David Belasco`s 1912 Broadway production of The Governors Lady created a sensation with a scene set in a Childs cafeteria, a chain restaurant that was an innovator in food standardization and emblematic of modern everyday life. While Belasco`s meticulously detailed reproduction of an immediately recognizable setting impressed the public, it was derided by progressive theater critics who championed the New Stagecraft theories of European artists like Max Reinhardt. The New Stagecraft rejected theatrical literalism; it drew inspiration from the subjectivity and minimalism of modern painters, advocating simplified sets designed to express a dramatic texts central ideas. Such critics considered Belasco a craftsman who merely captured surface realities: a true artist eliminated the inessential to create more meaningful, expressive stage images.

The author of the passage implies which of the following about Belasco`s production of The Governors Lady?

A It was dismissed by certain theater critics who misunderstood Belasco`s conception of modernity.

B It was intended to marshal elements of the New Stagecraft to serve Belasco`s predilection for realistic staging.

C It demonstrated that theatrical literalism could be used effectively to express a dramatic texts central ideas.

D It elicited responses that reflected a discrepancy between popular tastes in entertainment and the tastes of progressive theater critics.

E It relied on the appeal of an impressively realistic stage set to compensate for weaknesses in other aspects of the production.

正确答案为D，文章中created a sensation， impressed the public都表示观众很喜欢，后半部分则是progressive theater critics不认同。本题正确率较高。

It can be inferred that the theater critics would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements about the theatrical productions?

A Theatrical productions that seek to eliminate the inessential also often eliminate theatrical elements that enhance the expressiveness of a play.

B Theatrical productions that faithfully recreate the visual details of everyday life are unlikely to do justice to a good play`s central ideas.

C Theatrical productions that employ the minimalism characteristic of modern paintings may have greater appeal to modern audiences than productions that rely on theatrical literalism.

D Theatrical productions that aim to represent truths about modern life should not attempt to employ elements of the New Stagecraft.

E Theatrical productions that attempt to produce authentic-looking scenes of everyday reality are likely to fail in that goal because of the theaters inherent limitations.

选择B。Do justice to 的意思是to treat or show (something or someone) in a way that is as good as it should be，不认识也不要紧，直到这是一个正向的词汇即可。错误选项主要集中在A和C，两者均和文章观点背离，eliminate the inessential是这些批评家支持的，而 employ the minimalism characteristic of modern paintings这个是批评家喜欢的，而大众未必认可。
