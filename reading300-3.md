A decrease in face-to-face social contact can precipitate depression. Time spent using the Internet cannot be spent in face-to-face social contact, so psychologists have speculated that sharply increasing Internet use can cause depression. Studies of regular Internet users have found a significantly higher incidence of depression among those who had recently doubled the amount of time they spent using the Internet than among those whose use had not increased. Hence, the psychologists' speculation is correct.

第1题
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A. In general, the reason that the people in the studies had doubled their Internet use was not that they had earlier experienced a significant decrease in opportunities for face-to-face social contract.
B. A sharp decrease in face-to-face social contact is the only change in daily activity that can lead to an increased incidence of depression.
C. Using the Internet presents no opportunities for people to increase the amount of face-to-face social contact they experienced in their daily lives.
D. Regular Internet users who are depressed will experience an immediate improvement in mood if they sharply decrease the amount of time they spend on the Internet.
E. Before they doubled the time they spent on the Internet, the people who did so were already more prone to depression than are regular Internet users in general.




这里的逻辑关系是
（1）前提：F2F的社交减少会导致抑郁
（2）前提：上网增加会影响F2F社交的时间
（3）观察到：上网时间加倍人群抑郁比例显著提高
（4）结论：上网时间增大导致了抑郁

这里缺失的是因果联系，发生的先后并不能代表因果。本题40%的人选择了C。 然而C是对原文Time spent using the Internet cannot be spent in face-to-face social contact的直接重复。其他选项B无中生有，D是结果的一个可能推论（甚至有过度推论之嫌，因为Regluar Internet user抑郁的原因未必是上网）。E选项如果成立则会直接削弱文章的结论，因为这样的话他们抑郁的原因可能是他们本身就more prone to depression。
A之所以是对的，是因为一旦对A取反，文章的结论就不成立了；如果A取反，他们上网增多的原因是F2F时间的减少，那么直接就否定了上网增加和抑郁的关系，上网时间增加和抑郁都是F2F时间减少的结果。
