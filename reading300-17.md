Early naturalists believed two species of beaver lived in North America: dam beavers and bank beavers. The bank species was thought to resemble the muskrat in behavior, living in burrows or lodges and unable to build dams. In fact, dams are primarily a strategy for dealing with annual variations in water levels. If water levels fall in summer, as they do in most of North America, then beavers lodge entrances may be exposed. With stabilized water levels, their homes are much safer. Along deep rivers, where bank beavers are found, this problem seldom arises. But these beavers do know how to build dams, and do so if the need arises, as may occur if they are forced to relocate after felling and consuming all nearby trees.

The passage provides support for which of the following statements about beaver dams?

A One important function of these dams is to protect beavers homes.

B Most are built prior to burrow construction.

C They are found mostly along deep rivers.

D They are routinely abandoned as nearby forests are depleted.

E They mainly protect beavers from rising water levels.

选择A，正确率很高。dams是一种应对water levels变化的策略，目的是防止洞口暴露。错误主要集中在E，E错在If water levels fall in summer, as they do in most of North America, then beavers lodge entrances may be exposed.水面下降，才会有危险。

The passage implies which of the following about beavers?

A Bank beavers are unable to successfully compete with dam beavers when resources become scarce.

B Differences in dam-building behavior among beavers do not necessarily imply multiple beaver species.

C Building dams eventually causes beavers to deplete nearby resources.

D When conditions permit, beavers are more likely to build dams than burrows or lodges.

E In beavers, dam-building is an acquired rather than an innate skill.

选择B，文章逻辑是Early naturalists（early这个词就表示他们很可能是错的）认为beaver分两种，依据是一个会造dam，一个不会，结果文章发现，他们都会，所以这个分类站不住脚。对应文章的do not necessarily imply，说得滴水不漏。

错误集中在C和E。先说C，即时看不懂原文最后的逻辑，may occur if就表示只是一种可能；E选项，文章没有谈先天和习得，如果改成主动技能或者被动技能，可能会好一些。
