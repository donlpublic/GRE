Currently, Sulandian television journalists are twice as likely as other workers to support the Blue Party, and Sulandian journalism students are significantly more likely to support the Blue Party than working television journalists are. Therefore, assuming that these students do not change their political affiliations as they get older, the disparity between the political affiliations of Sulandia`s television journalists and those of the rest of the working population will increase as current Sulandian journalism students enter the profession.

Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?

A Few of the television journalists currently working in Sulandia were trained in Sulandian journalism schools.

B Journalists in Sulandia whose political affiliations differ from those of the general population tend to allow their political views to affect the way they report news about politics.

C Most of the television journalists currently working in Sulandia who support the Blue Party also supported the Blue Party when they were students.

D Support for the Blue party is not significantly less common among those current Sulaidan journalism students who intend to become television journalists than it is among current Sulandian journalism students as a whole.

E Classes in Sulandian journalism schools are not taught mainly by working Sulandian journalists.

文章说，记者比其他工人更支持BP，记者学生比记者更支持BP，一旦这些记者学生变成记者（假设他们政治倾向不变），记者vs其他工人的政治倾向差异将会加大。

这里有如下几个逻辑漏洞：
（1） 记者学生未必全都成为了记者

（2） 一旦大量记者学生加入其他职业，这一政治倾向差异将可能缩小

（3） 其他职业的新生代力量可能比记者学生更支持BP

然后才是D选项，有志于成为记者的记者学生也是非常支持BP的。

错误主要集中在C，无论C是否正确，都不会影响结论，因为这些已经是记者的人，不会影响未来的趋势。
