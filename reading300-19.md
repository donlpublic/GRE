The history of the transmission of ancient Roman texts prior to invention of the printing press is reconstructed from evidence both internal and external to the texts themselves. Internal evidence is used to reconstruct the relationship of the surviving manuscripts of a Roman text to one another, as represented in a modern stemma codicum: a diagram depicting the genealogical relationship of surviving manuscripts and those the stemmas editor believes existed at one time. Stemma are scholar's only road maps to textual connections based on internal evidence, but they may paint a distorted picture of reality because they diagram the relationships of only those manuscripts known or inferred today. If surviving copies are few, the stemma perforce brings into proximity manuscripts that were widely separated in time and place of origin. Conversely, the stemma can also bestow a semblance of separation on manuscripts written within a few months of one another or even in the same room.

本段有一些生词，例如stemma和genealogical，可以根据stem词根和gene词根推测。
必然；必定；势必Perforce is used to indicate that something happens or is the case because it cannot be prevented or avoided.
相反地;反过来说 You say conversely to indicate that the situation you are about to describe is the opposite or reverse of the one you have just described.
假象;表象;外观 If there is a semblance of a particular condition or quality, it appears to exist, even though this may be a false impression.

One type of external evidence that may shed light on the transmission of Roman texts is the availability of a work in the Middle Ages, when many classical texts were circulated. Too often, though, too much is inferred about a particular works circulation in the Middle Ages from the number of manuscripts surviving today. When a work survives in a single manuscript copy, editors call the manuscript, rather glamorously, the lone survivor–implying that all its (presumably rare) companions were destroyed sometime early in the Middle Ages by pillaging barbarians. It is equally possible that the work survived far into the Middle Ages in numerous copies in monastic libraries but were unnoticed due to lack of interest. The number of extant manuscripts, however few, really does not allow scholars to infer how many ancient Latin manuscripts of a work survived to the ninth, the twelfth, or even the fifteenth century.

富有魅力的；迷人的；令人向往的 If you describe someone or something as glamorous, you mean that they are more attractive, exciting, or interesting than ordinary people or things.
抢劫；劫掠；掠夺 If a group of people pillage a place, they steal property from it using violent methods.
中世纪（公元476年-公元1492年）是欧洲历史三大传统划分（“古典时代”、“中世纪”和“近现代”）的一个中间时期，始于西罗马帝国（公元476年）的灭亡，终于东罗马帝国（公元1453年）的灭亡

Quotations from a Roman text by a medieval author are another category of external evidence: but does the appearance of a rare word or grammatical construction-or even a short passage-really indicate a medieval author's firsthand knowledge of this or that ancient work, or does such usage instead derive from some intermediate source, such as a grammar book or a popular style manual? Medieval authors do quote extensively from ancient authors; while such quotations provide some evidence of the works medieval circulation, as well as define its evolving fortunes and the various uses to which it was put, they may be far less useful in reconstructing the text of an ancient work.

Much as scholars want to look for overall patterns and formulate useful generalizations, the transmission of each text is a different story and each manuscripts history is unique. Scholars must be careful not to draw conclusions that to beyond what the evidence can support.

The passage is primarily concerned with which of the following?

A tracing certain changes in the methods used to study the transmission of ancient Roman texts.

B contrasting two types of evidence used in investigating the transmission of ancient Roman texts.

C outlining certain difficulties associated with studying the transmission of ancient Roman texts.

D advocating the use of one type of evidence about ancient Roman texts over the use of another type.

E explaining the development and potential uses and drawbacks of stemmata in the study of ancient Roman texts.

争议主要集中B和C；之所以B不正确是，文章并没有对比B和C，C是最后一段，也是文章总结的改写。

As described in the passage, a stemma is most closely analogous to which of the following?

A a department store inventory list that excludes some departments

B a map from which a large section has been torn off

C a chronology that includes only major historical events

D a family tree in which some generations are not recorded

E a government organizational chart from which some agencies are omitted

这个题目选择D，重点在于a diagram depicting the genealogical（宗谱的/家谱的） relationship of surviving manuscripts and those the stemmas editor believes existed at one time，错误主要集中在B和C。B没有体现出宗谱性，C稍微接近，但是includes only major historical events（类似简明历史记录）和这里的通过留存下来的一些推断其他未能留存的稍有差别。

In its discussion of external evidence, the passage suggests which of the following about manuscripts of ancient Roman texts during the Middle Ages?

A It is possible that fewer manuscripts were destroyed by barbarians in the early Middle Ages than scholars frequently suppose.
正确：it is equally possible that the work survived far into the Middle Ages in numerous copies in monastic libraries but were unnoticed due to lack of interest. 之前被认为遭到破坏的，可能在修道院图书馆。

B Additional copies of some so-called lone survivor manuscripts may have existed well into the Middle Ages.
正确： possible that the work survived far into the Middle Ages 直接改写

C If an ancient Roman text is quoted in a work by a medieval author, then it is likely that at least one manuscript copy of that text survived into the Middle Ages.
错误：作者质疑but does the appearance of a rare word or grammatical construction-or even a short passage-really indicate a medieval author's firsthand knowledge 说明未必是第一手的资料，也就是未必见到了真的手稿

Click on the sentence in the first paragraph that suggests that scholars might be led to underestimate the extent of the connection between certain manuscripts.

定位这两句： If surviving copies are few, the stemma perforce brings into proximity manuscripts that were widely separated in time and place of origin. Conversely, the stemma can also bestow a semblance of separation on manuscripts written within a few months of one another or even in the same room.
第一句是把widely separated 变成proximity，这个是overestimate connection；第二句是给written within a few months of one another or even in the same room.赋予了separation的假象（semblance）；所以是underestimate了connection
